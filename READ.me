I have created a personal journal web app which allows you to make journal entries. The number of journal entries along with what date they were posted is also shown. 
There is functionality to create an account, log in, aswell as customize your personal
profile. please view the pics to see what the app looks like, as I have not bought a domain yet.

Upcoming features include: search engine to search for other users for profile viewing. 

Tech used: flask, python, html, css, and SQLAlchemy (sqlite3)
